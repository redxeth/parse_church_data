# parse_church_data
code for parsing St. Paul Lutheran Church in Austin database data

Basically reads CSV provided by Church Secretary and can generate various types of output, mainly a CSV that can be 
easily imported into Google Maps.   Would prefer to update to use Google API to handle the plotting side more automatically.
